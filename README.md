## Data
Database is composed by several raw and big size files. We made all the necessary transformations and sanitization. You can find it in the Mandely repository https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/g3vxppc8k4/1. Note: As it is a real dataset all data is masked.

## Preprocessing
This version is a simplified one. Here it is only the model application. All the preprocessing modules were retired because of simplicity. Again, do not hesitate to contact us if you want to take a look to it. 

## Requerimentes

You need Python 3.6 or later to run the model. You can check the configuration [setup](setup.cfg) file for the package requeriments. 

## Quick Start

If Python on your system is configured properly you can run the program like this:

```
$ python main.py
```

The model can be integrated into popular IDEs:

* PyCharm: [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
